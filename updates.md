# Progress Log

## 2025-02-09: Memory Bank Structure Reorganization

### Completed (2025-02-09 17:45)
1. **Memory Bank Structure Improvements**
   - Established strict separation between core and additional files
   - Defined core files to remain in memory-bank/ root only:
     - activeContext.md
     - productContext.md
     - progress.md
     - decisionLog.md
   - Created dedicated plans/ subdirectory for all additional files
   - Updated all system prompts to enforce new structure

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Modified all .clinerules files to reflect new structure
   - Updated file path handling in system prompts
   - Revised documentation to clarify file organization
   - Added explicit directory structure guidelines

3. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Updated README.md with new directory tree
   - Enhanced developer-primer.md with structure guidelines
   - Clarified file placement rules in system documentation
   - Added migration guidance for existing projects

### Latest Features
1. **Structured File Organization**
   - Clear separation of core and additional files
   - Dedicated plans/ subdirectory for project-specific content
   - Simplified root-level Memory Bank structure
   - Consistent file organization across all modes

2. **Operational Improvements**
   - Clearer file hierarchy
   - Simplified file management
   - Better organized project documentation
   - Enhanced maintainability

### Next Steps
1. **Implementation Tasks**
   - Migrate existing additional files to plans/ directory
   - Validate file path updates in all configurations
   - Test file operations with new structure
   - Update any remaining documentation

2. **Future Considerations**
   - Consider additional subdirectory organization in plans/
   - Monitor effectiveness of new structure
   - Gather user feedback on organization
   - Plan potential refinements

### Known Issues
- Existing projects may need manual file reorganization
- Some documentation may still reference old structure

This document tracks the progress of the Roo Code Memory Bank project.

## Work Done

### February 9, 2025 - Memory Bank File Handling Improvements
- Revised Memory Bank file handling approach:
  - Defined four core Memory Bank files
  - Removed specific filename searches from .clinerules
  - Implemented more flexible Memory Bank detection
  - Moved projectBrief.md to project root
  - Added user prompts for creating missing core files
- Updated documentation to reflect new Memory Bank structure
- Improved support for existing projects with different file organizations

### February 9, 2025 - Enhanced Roo Mode Behaviors
- Created comprehensive mode configuration files (.clinerules-*) for all three modes
- Added explicit instructions for Memory Bank initialization and usage
- Implemented consistent behavior across modes:
  - Immediate reading of all Memory Bank files on activation
  - Restricted use of attempt_completion directive
  - Added task presentation based on Memory Bank content
  - Improved user interaction flow
- Added detailed UMB (Update Memory Bank) procedures for each mode

### Previous Work
- Created and populated initial Memory Bank structure
- Implemented basic Memory Bank detection and initialization
- Developed initial mode-specific rules and responsibilities
- Created documentation framework
- Resolved various tool-related issues and bugs

### Completed in Current Session (2025-02-09)

#### Mode Definition Improvements
- Completely revised role definitions for all three modes:
  - Architect: Strategic leader for system design and documentation
  - Code: Implementation-focused developer
  - Ask: Knowledge assistant and documentation analyzer
- Added explicit responsibilities and collaboration patterns
- Clarified file authority for each mode

#### Memory Bank System Enhancements
- Standardized Memory Bank detection process across all modes
- Added explicit tool calling syntax in rules
- Implemented clear mode-specific responses to Memory Bank states
- Improved status prefix handling (`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE/INACTIVE]`)

#### Rule File Updates
- Updated all `.clinerules-xxx` files with improved structure
- Added standardized Memory Bank detection procedures
- Clarified mode collaboration patterns
- Enhanced UMB process documentation

## Current Status

Mode definitions and Memory Bank management rules have been significantly improved. The system is ready for testing with the new rules to verify improved reliability and clarity in mode interactions. Next step is to test the revised system with Roo to validate the changes.
